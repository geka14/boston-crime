# Crime in Boston Exploratory Data Analysis Using R

## Context
This project aims to analyze the crime data in Boston to better understand the patterns and behaviour of criminals in Boston area.

## Methodology
The data analysis process is conducted through 2 main steps using R programming language:
- Data preprocessing of the raw data
- Exploratory data analysis

## Data Source
The data used for this project was taken from https://www.kaggle.com/AnalyzeBoston/crimes-in-boston.

## Findings & Reccomendations
1. Criminality rates in Boston is very high during the month of July and August. This should be something that is closely monitored by the police officers in Boston area to increase the security during those months. These findings are also important for store owners to make sure that they are increasing their security even more during those months.
2. Criminality rates in Boston is higher during the weekdays, especially in the afternoon (15.00 - 18.00 PM). Similar to the previous recommendation, police officers and store owners should be more aware to prevent criminal activities during these period.
3. Based on district analysis, it is apparent that Roxbury district is the district with the highest criminality rate in Boston area. This is further proven by external data found from Areavibes.com where it was stated that Roxbury have an overall crime rate of 85% higher compared to the average crime rate in the US.
4. Larceny is the most common criminal activity that happens in Boston area. It is most apparent in the B4 district, especially in the Boylon ST. Local authorities could use these findings to allocate more resource to provide a better security measure in that street.
5. Improvement of security measures in Boston area could be done through addition of CCTV cameras on streets that are most vulnerable to criminal activities, as well as imposing stricter security measures through additional security guards at places and times that have a high risk of criminal activities.
